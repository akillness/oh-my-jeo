# Prepared guidance: data-analysis

Family: `data-analysis`<br>
Category: `analysis`<br>
Phase: `data-task`<br>
Role: `guide`

## Contract
[omh] Dataset or table to analyze: scope supplied data with provenance, causal-claim, and hallucination guards. Use when the user says: data-analysis, data analysis, dataset analysis, csv analysis, json analysis, log analysis, table analysis, analyze csv.

This is a source-pinned, prepared-only contract. It is routing and handoff guidance, not provider, executor, dispatch, verification, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.

## Triggers
- data-analysis
- data analysis
- dataset analysis
- csv analysis
- json analysis
- log analysis
- table analysis
- analyze csv

## Required inputs
- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

## Expected outputs
- data_analysis_task_card/v1
- dataset_scope/v1
- analysis_method_plan/v1
- operations_data_harness/v1
- product_evidence_loop/v1
- analysis_result_summary/v1 when observed
- next action
- prepared-vs-observed boundary

## Artifact expectations
- data_analysis_task_card/v1 metadata-only wrapper card when prepared
- dataset_scope/v1 with source, row/record scope, columns or schema, filters, and stop condition
- analysis_method_plan/v1 naming summary, anomaly, trend, segment, schema, or log-pattern methods
- operations_data_harness/v1 for relationship and causal boundaries
- product_evidence_loop/v1 for prepared opaque data reference metadata
- analysis_result_summary/v1 only from observed data, calculations, query output, or supplied evidence

## Acceptance criteria
- Dataset or corpus source, record scope, schema or extraction method, join assumptions, analysis question, method, and stop condition are explicit.
- Numeric claims, anomalies, trends, segments, and log patterns are reported only from observed data or supplied evidence.
- Causal claims require observed identification evidence.
- Source acquisition, file conversion, report generation, and code fixes are routed to the narrower workflow when stronger.

## Handoff policy
Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded.

## Catalog rules
- Source routing exclusion: The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- Source routing exclusion: The user asks OMH to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- Source routing exclusion: The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.
- Route only on the source-defined description and triggers; do not treat nearest local contracts report-package as aliases.
- Keep this canonical ID as prepared guidance because the local catalog marks it preparedGuidanceMissing.
- Do not claim provider, executor, runtime, mutation, or observed-result capability from this metadata alone.

## Method references
- No source-specific method reference is declared; do not invent one.

## Source gaps
- The pinned upstream member declares no physical method reference; its SKILL.md source contract remains authoritative.

## Blocked prerequisites
- The local catalog member data-analysis is absent; nearest local contracts are explicitly non-equivalent.
- An explicit accepted handoff and matching observed provider, executor, or host evidence are required before execution claims.

## Evidence boundary
prepared_not_observed: this record is Hermes-facing prepared guidance only. Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded. No executor/provider/runtime execution, observed result, review, CI, deploy, or merge evidence is implied.
