# Materials Package

Portability: `portable`. This is host-neutral guidance, not a native plugin, persona replacement, or runtime hook.

## Host and Dependency Boundary

This workflow uses the selected host's existing tools; the OMJ CLI is not required to follow its guidance. Optional OMJ metadata persistence is a separately configured operation, never an implicit dependency.

The host owns tools, skill discovery, permissions, project trust, duplicate resolution, and delegation. Use only capabilities the host actually exposes. Missing tools require an explicit fallback or unresolved prerequisite, never hidden execution or permission bypass.

## Why This Exists

`materials-package` makes this workflow explicit: Plan decks, PDFs, spreadsheets, documents, HWP, or Markdown with target formats, inputs, QA, and explicit binary-export handoffs.

## Do Not Use When

- The user only needs a weekly/monthly report outline; use `report-package`.
- The user asks for recurring meeting minutes or scrum history; use `operating-rhythm`.
- The request is code documentation, README, or project wiki maintenance; use the docs/wiki workflow.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: materials-package 엑셀 매출 리포트를 PDF로 공유할 수 있게 준비해줘.
- Expected behavior: Create a material plan with xlsx/pdf target formats, source inputs, missing metrics, QA checks, and a generation handoff boundary.
- Why: The request is about material processing and binary export evidence, not just a text report outline.

Bad example:

- Prompt: materials-package prove the PDF was sent to leadership.
- Expected behavior: Ask for observed delivery evidence or record the delivery as not_observed instead of claiming it happened.
- Why: A prepared material artifact cannot prove export, approval, or delivery.

## Completion Checklist

- The material source, target format, audience, structure, and QA expectation are named.
- Binary export, rendering, formula recalculation, attachment, and delivery stay observed-only.
- The next action identifies whether the package is planned, generated, QA-ready, or blocked.

## Recovery Notes

- If a renderer or file tool is missing, keep the package prepared and expose the generation handoff.
- If render QA is unavailable, mark the artifact unverified and request the smallest visual/file check.

## Use When

Plan decks, PDFs, spreadsheets, documents, HWP, or Markdown with target formats, inputs, QA, and explicit binary-export handoffs.

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `materials`
Phase: `material-plan`
Host-owned workflow responsibility
Quality tier: `material-gated`

Quality bar:

- Name audience, source inputs, target formats, outline sections, assumptions, missing inputs, and output owner.
- Attach format-specific QA expectations before preparing a binary-generation handoff.
- Record binary export, render QA, formula checks, approvals, and delivery only from observed evidence.

Handoff policy:

Plan decks, PDFs, spreadsheets, documents, HWP, or Markdown with target formats, inputs, QA, and explicit binary-export handoffs. Keep planning, coordination, and implementation ownership explicit. Prepare a selected coding-owner handoff only for accepted code work. External effects and memory/configuration writes require their own approval; prepared artifacts are not execution evidence.

Required inputs:

- audience or recipient
- source inputs
- target format(s)
- deadline or delivery context
- missing data or assumptions

Expected outputs:

- material_artifact/v1 plan
- format-specific QA ladder
- executor-neutral generation handoff when needed
- observed export boundary

Artifact expectations:

- material_artifact/v1 under .omj/materials when a wrapper or CLI records it

Safety rules:

- Do not claim PPTX, PDF, Keynote, DOCX, XLSX, HWP, or upload output without observed file evidence.
- Do not claim render QA, formula recalculation, approval, or delivery from a prepared material plan.
- Keep source facts, assumptions, missing inputs, and generated output evidence separate.

## Execution and Handoff Discipline

1. State the target, constraints, acceptance criteria, authority, and stop condition before work.
2. Planning and coordination do not take ownership of code implicitly. Keep the selected first-class coding owner explicit, including the current host when selected.
3. Read supporting references only when needed using available host file tools; loading guidance is not dispatch or plan acceptance.
4. Take acceptance only from the user's actual answer. A timeout, dismissal, or missing answer leaves the plan unaccepted; prepare no handoff and start nothing.
5. A selected owner, task card, plan, or prepared handoff stays `prepared_not_observed` until observed execution evidence exists. Preserve failures and unresolved criteria.
6. Verify behavior with the smallest relevant observed check. Current loader admission is not evidence of a live session; local fresh files do not prove host discovery, execution, review, CI, or merge.
7. Network operations, configuration or memory writes, external publishing, and new authority remain separately approval-gated. Do not activate unsupported services.
