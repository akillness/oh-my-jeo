# Strategy Brief

Portability: `portable`. This is host-neutral guidance, not a native plugin, persona replacement, or runtime hook.

## Host and Dependency Boundary

This workflow uses the selected host's existing tools; the OMJ CLI is not required to follow its guidance. Optional OMJ metadata persistence is a separately configured operation, never an implicit dependency.

The host owns tools, skill discovery, permissions, project trust, duplicate resolution, and delegation. Use only capabilities the host actually exposes. Missing tools require an explicit fallback or unresolved prerequisite, never hidden execution or permission bypass.

## Why This Exists

`strategy-brief` makes this workflow explicit: Turn goals and evidence into options, tradeoffs, a recommendation, and a decision-ready brief.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is casual chat, a status-only acknowledgement, or another workflow has stronger routing evidence.
- The user needs implementation, review, CI, merge, or external publishing evidence that has not been delegated or observed.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: strategy-brief: decide whether our onboarding should prioritize solo founders or enterprise buyers.
- Expected behavior: Frame options, tradeoffs, assumptions, rejected paths, and the decision evidence needed.
- Why: The request is strategy-shaped and should not jump directly into implementation.

Bad example:

- Prompt: strategy-brief: treat casual chat or unaccepted work as if this workflow already produced verified results.
- Expected behavior: Ask a clarification question or route to a narrower workflow instead of forcing `strategy-brief`.
- Why: The request lacks required inputs or would overclaim unobserved work.

## Completion Checklist

- The decision, options, tradeoffs, assumptions, and rejected alternatives are named.
- Observed signals are separated from strategic inference.
- Accepted decisions and implementation follow-ups are not conflated.

## Recovery Notes

- If evidence is mostly assumption, label it and recommend a research or feedback-triage pass.
- If the decision owner is missing, keep the output as options rather than accepted strategy.

## Use When

Turn goals and evidence into options, tradeoffs, a recommendation, and a decision-ready brief.

Strong routing signals: `strategy-brief`, `strategy brief`, `strategy memo`, `product strategy`, `strategic options`, `decision note`, `leadership strategy`, `next strategy`, `다음 전략`, `전략 정리`, `전략 메모`, `전략 옵션`, `의사결정`, `리더십 회의`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `strategy`
Phase: `brief`
Host-owned workflow responsibility
Quality tier: `decision-gated`

Quality bar:

- Name the decision, constraints, options, tradeoffs, and rejected alternatives.
- Tie recommendations to observed evidence or mark them as assumptions.
- Keep coding handoff disabled until strategy is accepted and code work is explicit.

Handoff policy:

Turn goals and evidence into options, tradeoffs, a recommendation, and a decision-ready brief. Keep planning, coordination, and implementation ownership explicit. Prepare a selected coding-owner handoff only for accepted code work. External effects and memory/configuration writes require their own approval; prepared artifacts are not execution evidence.

Required inputs:

- goal
- known evidence
- constraints
- decision owner

Expected outputs:

- options
- tradeoffs
- recommended direction
- decision note

Artifact expectations:

- strategy brief or decision note when a wrapper captures it

Safety rules:

- Do not treat a draft recommendation as an accepted decision.
- Keep unresolved assumptions visible.
- Separate strategy from implementation planning unless the user asks for execution.

## Execution and Handoff Discipline

1. State the target, constraints, acceptance criteria, authority, and stop condition before work.
2. Planning and coordination do not take ownership of code implicitly. Keep the selected first-class coding owner explicit, including the current host when selected.
3. Read supporting references only when needed using available host file tools; loading guidance is not dispatch or plan acceptance.
4. Take acceptance only from the user's actual answer. A timeout, dismissal, or missing answer leaves the plan unaccepted; prepare no handoff and start nothing.
5. A selected owner, task card, plan, or prepared handoff stays `prepared_not_observed` until observed execution evidence exists. Preserve failures and unresolved criteria.
6. Verify behavior with the smallest relevant observed check. Current loader admission is not evidence of a live session; local fresh files do not prove host discovery, execution, review, CI, or merge.
7. Network operations, configuration or memory writes, external publishing, and new authority remain separately approval-gated. Do not activate unsupported services.
