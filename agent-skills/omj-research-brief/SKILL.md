# Research Brief

Portability: `portable`. This is host-neutral guidance, not a native plugin, persona replacement, or runtime hook.

## Host and Dependency Boundary

This workflow uses the selected host's existing tools; the OMJ CLI is not required to follow its guidance. Optional OMJ metadata persistence is a separately configured operation, never an implicit dependency.

The host owns tools, skill discovery, permissions, project trust, duplicate resolution, and delegation. Use only capabilities the host actually exposes. Missing tools require an explicit fallback or unresolved prerequisite, never hidden execution or permission bypass.

## Why This Exists

`research-brief` makes this workflow explicit: Scope a business question and produce source-backed research with explicit evidence and inference boundaries.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is casual chat, a status-only acknowledgement, or another workflow has stronger routing evidence.
- The user needs implementation, review, CI, merge, or external publishing evidence that has not been delegated or observed.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: research-brief: compare three onboarding analytics vendors using customer notes and confidence gaps.
- Expected behavior: Prepare a source-backed brief with evidence, inference, confidence, and retrieval gaps separated.
- Why: The user needs business research synthesis, not recurring operations or coding.

Bad example:

- Prompt: research-brief: treat casual chat or unaccepted work as if this workflow already produced verified results.
- Expected behavior: Ask a clarification question or route to a narrower workflow instead of forcing `research-brief`.
- Why: The request lacks required inputs or would overclaim unobserved work.

## Completion Checklist

- The research question, source boundaries, recency assumptions, and confidence level are named.
- Observed sources, inference, synthesis, and unresolved retrieval gaps are separated.
- Follow-up planning or handoff uses the research summary without calling it execution evidence.

## Recovery Notes

- If sources cannot be accessed, state the retrieval gap and use only observed local context.
- If evidence is thin or one-sided, lower confidence and ask for a narrower source boundary.

## Use When

Scope a business question and produce source-backed research with explicit evidence and inference boundaries.

Strong routing signals: `research-brief`, `business-research`, `business research`, `research brief`, `source-backed business research`, `customer feedback trends`, `feedback trends`, `market evidence`, `data search`, `source scan`, `자료 조사`, `데이터 서치`, `근거 조사`, `피드백 추세`, `고객 피드백 추세`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `research`
Phase: `business-brief`
Host-owned workflow responsibility
Quality tier: `source-gated`

Quality bar:

- State the research question, source boundaries, and recency assumptions before synthesis.
- Separate observed sources, source quality, source diversity, inferred trends, and unresolved uncertainty.
- Use the brief to feed strategy or meeting work without calling it execution evidence.

Handoff policy:

Scope a business question and produce source-backed research with explicit evidence and inference boundaries. Keep planning, coordination, and implementation ownership explicit. Prepare a selected coding-owner handoff only for accepted code work. External effects and memory/configuration writes require their own approval; prepared artifacts are not execution evidence.

Required inputs:

- business question
- source boundary
- recency or market scope

Expected outputs:

- evidence table
- inference summary
- confidence and uncertainty

Artifact expectations:

- research brief or source ledger when the wrapper captures observed sources

Safety rules:

- Claim source retrieval only from observed tool results.
- Separate evidence, inference, confidence, source diversity, and missing-source gaps.
- Route later implementation separately through an accepted plan and coding handoff.

## Execution and Handoff Discipline

1. State the target, constraints, acceptance criteria, authority, and stop condition before work.
2. Planning and coordination do not take ownership of code implicitly. Keep the selected first-class coding owner explicit, including the current host when selected.
3. Read supporting references only when needed using available host file tools; loading guidance is not dispatch or plan acceptance.
4. Take acceptance only from the user's actual answer. A timeout, dismissal, or missing answer leaves the plan unaccepted; prepare no handoff and start nothing.
5. A selected owner, task card, plan, or prepared handoff stays `prepared_not_observed` until observed execution evidence exists. Preserve failures and unresolved criteria.
6. Verify behavior with the smallest relevant observed check. Current loader admission is not evidence of a live session; local fresh files do not prove host discovery, execution, review, CI, or merge.
7. Network operations, configuration or memory writes, external publishing, and new authority remain separately approval-gated. Do not activate unsupported services.
